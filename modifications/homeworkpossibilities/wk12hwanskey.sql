-- Background:
-- You have been hired by BYU-I Air to help sort through the airportdb database. 
-- Each week you will receive a file from your manager with questions that 
-- need answered by writing queries against the database. 
-- This week your manager wants you to understand what views and CTE expressions are. 

-- week 12 questions
USE airportdb;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Create a view from week 10 question 1. Make a table based on that view
--    named `passengerrewards`. Provide a select statement that queries the table.
--    DO NOT use a select * statement.
--    The columns should look like the following:
--    | Status | Number of Flights | First Name | Last Name |
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT pr.status
,      pr.number_of_flights
,      pr.first_name
,      pr.last_name
FROM   passengerrewards pr;

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. What are the top 10 airports that handled the highest number of flights in August?
--    Write a CTE statement called `flight_counts` to find the answer.
--    Columns will look like the following:
--    | Airport | Flight Count |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH flight_counts AS (
    SELECT a.name AS airport
	,      COUNT(f.flight_id) AS flight_count
    FROM   airport a
	INNER JOIN flight f
    ON     a.airport_id = f.from
    WHERE  f.departure BETWEEN '2015-07-01' AND '2015-07-31'
    GROUP BY a.name
)
SELECT fc.airport AS 'Airport'
,      fc.flight_count AS 'Flight Count'
FROM   flight_counts fc
ORDER BY fc.flight_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. What are the top 5 longest flights by duration for each airline?
--    Don't include any duplicates.
--    Sort the results by airline name and rank.
--    Write a CTE statement called `ranked_flights` to find the answer.
--    Columns will look like the following:
--    | Airline | Flight Number | Origin Airport | Destination Airport | Flight Duration (Minutes) |
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WITH ranked_flights AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT al.airlinename
	,      f.flightno
	,      a.name AS origin_airport
	,      a2.name AS destination_airport
	,      TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, f.departure, f.arrival) AS duration_minutes
	,      DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY al.airlinename ORDER BY (SELECT duration_minutes) DESC) AS 'rank'
    FROM   airline al
    INNER JOIN flight f
    ON     al.airline_id = f.airline_id
    INNER JOIN airport a
    ON     f.from = a.airport_id
    INNER JOIN airport a2
    ON     f.to = a2.airport_id
)
SELECT rf.airlinename AS 'Airline'
,      rf.flightno AS 'Flight Number'
,      rf.origin_airport AS 'Origin Airport'
,      rf.destination_airport AS 'Destination Airport'
,      rf.duration_minutes AS 'Flight Duration (Minutes)'
FROM   ranked_flights rf
WHERE  rf.rank <= 5
ORDER BY rf.airlinename
,        rf.rank;
